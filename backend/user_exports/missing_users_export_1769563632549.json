    "answers": [
      "My experience with PCB design revolves around academic research and international robotics competitions. My process consists of sketching the schematic on paper, prototyping on a protoboard, testing, and manufacturing once the test is validated. On paper, I list and sketch all the necessary components, the microcontrollers, sensors, power distribution components, signals, and then I test this on the protoboard. Once this test is validated, then I design on the CAD platform called EasyEDA, ensuring correct routing and placement of the necessary components. Once this design is validated, then I send this design to manufacturing. I do this process in order to ensure functionality and reliable designs in competition environments.",
      "I have used Python in AI systems development and robotics research applications. One example was when I developed a semantic search algorithm for a custom CRM using natural language processing via an LLM and the OpenAI API. My approach is to first design the data flow using a flow diagram or block logic in order for me to understand how the pipeline logic works for prompt parsing and the response. Once I have a clear idea of how the pipeline works, then I proceed to code the Python logic. I also used Python in robotics-based research within a ROS-based system that integrated sensors and an autonomous vehicle functionality. So I mainly use Python as a bridge between algorithms, AI, and real-world applications.",
      "In team conflicts, I take a facilitator role, which means I serve as a bridge between my teammates' perspectives. One example was when I participated in an entrepreneurship bootcamp at Madrid, where my team and I needed to present an MVP for a financial startup and also a pitch. In the beginning, we had conflicted ideas about product direction and we even ended up in discussions. But then I proposed we should all externalize our ideas, list the pros and cons, and base our conclusions on feasibility. Once we determined feasibility, we cleared the product direction and developed the working MVP, passing from opinion-based discussion to a more criteria-based. So this showed me that structure and active listening are important for conflict resolution.",
      "I categorize tasks and projects from the most critical to the least based on priority. This allows me to categorize them, organize my work and also ensure effective communication among my teammates. One example was when I worked as a mechanical designer in an industrial automation setting where I was responsible for managing multiple projects with multiple components and schedules considering lead times. So I would list the most critical projects we had at the time. I would also take note of what I needed, of what my team needed, and I developed a plan along with them for what tasks needed to be accomplished at the moment that ensured that the project worked in the most precise way possible in order for us to deliver it and avoid last-minute surprises and focus on team effort ensuring proactive communication and react instead of reactive problem solving",
      "I'm a mechatronics engineer that sees the intersection of robotics, AI, and mechanical systems, the same way Mirai Innovation focuses on combining applied research, emerging technologies, and real-world social impact. I see this as an opportunity to not only deepen my technical skills, but also contribute to projects that turn research into practical solutions in one of the strongest innovation ecosystems globally. I'm also open to learn about Japan's approach to innovation, with an emphasis on precision and social impact.",
      "I deserve to be awarded this scholarship because I bring a rare combination of technical capability, adaptability, and the ability to turn ideas into practical outcomes. My background working across industrial automation, applied AI, robotics research, and software development enabled me to have a multidisciplinary perspective while also developing effective communication skills, which are necessary for translating research into real world applications. So I see the scholarship how it allows me to fully commit and maximize my contribution while learning at the same time with researchers in an international setting. I see this not only as an investment in my development but also in the quality and the reach of the work I can contribute not only during but also after the research experience of Mirai Innovation"

    "answers": [
      "In my previous projects, I have used Docker and Kubernetes to manage and deploy containerized AI services in production environments. I primarily used Docker to containerize computer vision and machine learning services, ensuring reproducible environments across development, testing, and production. In an industrial project, I designed microservice-based architectures where each service handled a specific task, such as model inference or preprocessing images, and packaged them as Docker containers, and then deployed them as Cloud Run functions in Vertex AI technology. I then used Kubernetes to orchestrate these services, managing deployment, scaling, and reliability, this including configuring pods, services, and resource limits under heavy constraints on GPU usage. It allowed me to scale the services properly to the huge demand of our AI services",
      "When implementing machine learning algorithms in Python, I usually start by focusing on correctness and clarity before optimizing performance. I begin with a clean and modular implementation, making sure the data, pipeline, model definition, and evaluation metrics are well structured and reproducible. Once the baseline is working, I provide the code to identify bottlenecks, specifically in data loading and preprocessing, which are the heavy tasks, and also model inference by last. For performance optimization, I leverage vectorized operations, efficient data structures, and GPU accelerations using frameworks like PyTorch and TorchVision. I also use techniques such as mixed precision batching and asynchronous execution when appropriate. At the same time, I carefully monitor accuracy and stability of all the models I've worked with",
      "One situation where effective communication played a key role was during the development of the smart mirror system at the Puerto de Liverpool. I was responsible for designing the back-end architecture and the computer vision service from scratch, but the project involved multiple stakeholders including engineers, product managers, and non-technical decision makers. A key challenge was translating complex technical concepts such as real-time inference and system scalability into clear actionable information for different people. I focused on communicating the system design using simple diagrams, clear milestones, and concrete trade-offs. At the end of my internship, I actually did a final presentation with all the stakeholders and I managed to explain everything I did with everything that was necessary. Leading to the approval of the project deployment",
      "When handling conflicts within a team, I try to approach them in a calm and structured way, focusing on the problem rather than the personal opinions. My first step is usually to listen carefully to all perspectives involved, to make sure I understand the technical and practical concerns behind each position. In one project, there was a disagreement between team members about the system architecture and performance trade-offs under certain technologies. I helped resolve the conflict by breaking the discussion into concrete criteria, such as performance metrics, scalability, and maintainability of our test models, and proposing a small experiment to validate each approach of the project. By grounding the discussion in data and shared goals, we were able to reach a consensus and move forward effectively in the project. This experience reinforced my belief that conflicts can be managed constructively",
      "My motivation for applying to this project is specifically rooted in my interest in applied research environments where innovation is closely connected to real-world impact. Throughout my academic and professional experience I have focused on building AI systems that move beyond theory and are actually deployed under real constraints. What particularly attracts me to MIRAI innovation is its emphasis on hands-on research and prototyping and I see this program as an opportunity to contribute my background in applied AI and mathematics research in a highly interdisciplinary and international research environment. In addition to that Japan's culture of precision engineering excellence and long-term vision strongly resonates with how I approach technical work to this day. For me joining MIRAI innovation represents a meaningful step forward into becoming a better researcher",
