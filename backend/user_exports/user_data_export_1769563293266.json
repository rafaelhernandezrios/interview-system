    "answers": [
      "Yeah, yes, I have used Python in my previous project. Actually, most of my previous projects are Python-based. Let's take an example of the AI email automation agent where I used Python to connect to Telegram and my LLM to send or draft an email to another person. Yeah, one of the most common challenges I've faced in Python is that it's quite a rapidly evolving language. So, whenever I build something new or follow a new project, most of the documentation and stuff has been deprecated. Another challenge of using Python is that it's quite slow comparing to C++",
      "I have used TensorFlow in multiple projects actually regarding machine learning. So for example, in my previous internship, I used TensorFlow to fine-tune an already existing model that was MobileNet V2, which is used for embedded technologies to detect for facial recognition purposes. So our use case was quite small, so I used TensorFlow to fine-tune that MobileNet V2 to work more efficiently and accurately with our system. It was used in a facial recognition software that also worked in partially occluded scenarios. And for the model of detecting those partially occluded spaces, I also developed a model using TensorFlow. So it was quite a TensorFlow-heavy approach on that project",
      "The best way I can describe of my adaptability being tested is to describe my situations in different environments. So I have worked with multiple teams, both in my college and in my internship. And one thing I can say is that both had different, very different environments. So college one was very laid back and the internship was very fast-paced and everyone reacts differently to the rules and tasks provided to them. So I just, rather than judging everyone on the same level, I would rather observe them and figure out their way of thinking. This way, it would be easier for me to communicate with them and together we could achieve the same goal. It also makes me grow as a person and helps me better than understand my colleagues instead of just disagreeing and fighting with them constantly. Thank you",
      "Well, as stated in a previous answer, I'll take an example from both the scenarios. There comes a point where I have to determine how a single person reacts about doing a specific kind of thing. So, let's say person X is not supporting that decision and person Y is fully supporting it. So, I just hear both sides and project a solution or kind of a middle ground where all of us can work together to achieve the same goal. So, in college teams, it was quite an easy task as we all knew each other. But during my internship, I had to adapt to the situation to better understand my colleagues. So, I would rather hear everyone in the start than wasting time down the line",
      "Well, I've done quite some research on your website, and I'm really all into about solving real-world problems. So, not just picking up a project, random project, to produce some dummy results resulting from dummy data. I actually want to make an impact in the real world. I want to change some certain aspects of how things are working currently. And you guys are actually doing that. Apart from this, the technology compared to other research institutes, you guys have phenomenal technology at Mirai Institute. So yeah, I would like to pursue my research career at Mirai Institute. This was a result of me doing a lot of research, differing from multiple research institutes all over the world, and Mirai was at another level",
      "Well, not only I have experience in a lot of projects such as computer vision, generative AI and many other projects like reinforcement learning, I have also experience in publications. I know the research process. I know the research process. I know what it takes. I have the knowledge to write research papers. I know how to read them, what to extract from all of that information. I can also do research correctly and I can guarantee you that if you provide or if you award me with a scholarship, I can guarantee results at the end of my internship. I have also great adaptability. I have good communication with other teams. I have good perseverance. I have proved this in my previous internship also"

      "In my Unreal world, in my Unreal Engine world, I primarily use Blueprints for rapid prototyping and interactive worldbuilding, while developing an understanding on how the systems sit on top of the Unreal Engine's C++ architecture, and I focused on C++ concepts, such as classes, components, inheritance, and performance considerations, to inform Blueprint designs, which would help me make the structure cleaner and more modular on a scalable system, because there were times where we would connect it to a program called DaVinci, and things had to be quite precise in the scripting, the visualizing, and just the architectural awareness when projecting on virtual production",

      "For me, a good team is built on trust, clear communication and shared goals, and also respect for each other's personal strengths, while good individuals are being held accountable. And I think openness and adaptability is something that's really big. So to collaborate well, especially during difficult times, it helps to listen actively, stay calm, and to just communicate honestly and focus on solutions rather than shifting blame. And by being willing to ask for help or give constructive feedback, we can all benefit and be able to collaborate and make a bigger product or solution",
      "Funny enough, this actually happened very recently on my rocket team. So I am the lead design, structural design engineer and we faced a sort of a problem where efficiency had to also counterbalance with budget because we had a task to shoot a model rocket 200, 2000 feet but the material we wanted to use was too expensive and we did not have that in our resource or budget. So I as the lead engineer had to go and do research on suitable substitutes but also ways in which we kept within the budget. It took a lot of research and outside asking around but we were able to find a solution and now have a rocket which we're very glad about and i'm glad i got to commincate with my team.",
      "So for me, immersive tech is multifunctional and can be used to explore, communicate, and simulate real-world problems. And what drives me is curiosity and desire to create systems that have a positive practical impact on humanity. And I just feel like Mirai provides that resource, not only with the institution as a whole, but also with the mentorship that is offered. And so in facilities, and it being so internationally and so big, it just allows there to also be a cultural connection, also to learn from different perspectives. And having a passion, I understand how valuable knowledge and experience is, and to inspire those who reach tasks head-on. And that's why I'm motivated by Mirai, because they provide things in my interest, like AI, IoT, and robotics",
      "I deserve this scholarship because I combine scientific curiosity, computational skill and creative expression to approach programmes in an innovative and globally relevant way. My work spans computational modelling, data analysis of satellite data sets and AI projects with immersive technologies, whilst also drawing an artistic perspective through interactive experiences, virtual productions and visual storytelling. I'm particularly motivated by how emerging technologies can address actual global challenges across science, accessibility, sustainability. And through my leadership roles as President of the Space Society, Vice President and Lead Structural Engineer of the UK Sea Rocket Team, I've built inclusive communities, mental peers and collaborated across disciplines and cultures. This scholarship allows me to broaden my international perspective, strengthen my technical skills and to blend art and science and technology to contribute to a meaningful, interdisciplinary projects with global impact"

      "One of the projects in which I have been able to use data analysis in bioengineering is in the analysis of kinetic, kinematic and bio-signals data for the analysis of motor capacity in interest groups, in this case in young adults and older adults. From the extraction of characteristics both in the domain of time and frequency and in addition to statistical analysis, what we can do is establish metrics or quantitative parameters that allow us to measure what is muscle degeneration or loss of motor capacity over time. From this, then, we can establish strategies that are focused on therapies that fit the conditions and properties of each of the subjects and how to approach rehabilitation therapies taking into account the needs of the patient and how the motor capacities change with the age. Thank you",
      "Considering that I have a focus on rehabilitation, the design of robotic systems is always centered on the user.

This from the fact that we must always ensure that the user and the system will be safe and will not cause any damage. Once all the design criteria are established, we proceed with the creation of subsystems such as the mechanical, electronic, software and control and we do the manufacturing and validation of each of the systems individually. Then we do the conjunction of all the systems and we do a final test that validates the functionality of our system. This always taking into account security criteria and re-engineering process to evaluate the robustness of the system. Thank you",
      "One of the problems that I have been able to solve is in multidisciplinary teams where I have a medical team and an engineering team. What happens here is that both have a point of view focused on different parts, the doctors towards the user and those of engineering towards the robotic system. In this case, to be able to solve the problem as to what are the criteria that our system has to have, is to meet individually with each team to understand and listen what are their problems and points of view, and once this is established, we do a general meeting to be able to expose the ideas, establish what are the general goals that we have as a team and what is the best solution taking into account both parts. This generates a balanced communication throughout the team and a feeling of trust both among the members and the leader of the work.",
      "To be able to generate effective collaboration in the work team, what we do is establish clear goals, what are the roles of each participant, and what are the communication channels. As for the clear goals, what we do is a list of what are the individual goals that each one must meet in order to reach the global goal as a team. Among the communication channels, what I do is establish a trust environment where both the participating members and the leader can communicate openly and respectfully to generate a good work environment and greater communication. And finally, establish metrics or periodic meetings that allow us to review what the progress is and if there is any problem, to be able to address it as a team to find the best solution. Thank you.",
      "My biggest motivation to be able to participate in this program is to be able to learn from new methodologies and working groups, especially in MIRAI, which has been characterized by being one of the leaders and the precursors in the creation of new technology. My participation in the program would allow me to help consolidate my professional career, especially in research, from participating in different working groups and getting to know people around the world, which allows me to address problems from different perspectives. This will then be able to increase my capacity, both in my qualities as a leader and in my technical skills for the development of new technological developments, especially in the biomedical sector, in order to create new engineering or new technology with social impact. Thank you.",
      "I deserve this scholarship because I have tried to base my training as a professional on excellence and social impact. My participation with different working groups around the world in the area of biomedical engineering has allowed me to have a more global idea of how to address different problems, both in the technical, academic and social sectors. Additionally, I count skills such as punctuality, teamwork, innovation, creativity, which allows me to have skills that can contribute to the members or groups where I can participate in the MIRAI program. I believe that my participation in this program will also give me different tools that will allow me to consolidate as a researcher and generate a greater impact on the new technologies and developments that I am generating in my PhD.

    "answers": [
      "I've utilised Python mainly in two things. One is the back-end development and then the other is for machine learning. So, for example, from one of my recent projects, which is Oxford EDI Initiative, what I did with my team is we have a team of six and we are working on a project to tackle unconscious bias in interviews. And what we did is we utilised generative AI, for example, like frameworks like StyleGAN3 and also InterfaceGen, that is to pretty much generate a face and then modify the facial attributes for it to generate a gender-neutral face. And that will be applied to all applicants in the same interview so that the interviewers will not be able to discriminate interviewees based on their skin colour, gender, accent and etc. And that's how I use Python in AI accelerated development.",
      "Shell scripting is mainly used for generating a semi-automated pipeline for me to pretty much put all different progress of the same data analysis pipeline together. So, for example, in one of my experiments analysis is what I need to do is generate a new transcriptome for a non-model organism. So that includes preprocessing the data, for example, quality check, trimming the data, and then assemble the transcriptome, followed by another quality check psot-transcriptome assembly, and also about annotating the transcriptome. And shell scripting is used for generating different scripts for each progress step so that after running through that progress, you'll be able to check the output. And then whenever there's other colleagues want to run the same pipeline, they can just basically utilize the script I've generated to do the same thing",
      "Yeah, so one of my projects, which is miia, Medical Intelligence Applied, what I did is I am managing a team of up to 15 members across different disciplines, and that includes UX/UI design, software development, machine learning, business and medicine. And all team members are pretty much scattered across the world in different time zones and also different countries. So in order to manage a cross-functional and also cross-countries team, what I did is basically setting up project management tools that help facilitate mainly asynchronous updates, followed with one single source of truth, which is Google Drive, and also having Kanban boards in GitHub to monitor the progress of different tasks across different functional teams. And I, as the integrator, will be basically help translating concepts across different team members and helping them to work together, and that's how I manage.",
      "I'll give another example in another project, which is Envirovex, and we're a team of five members from different countries. One from Spain, two from the States, one from India, and I'm basically based in the UK. And that involves different time zones, and we are in different countries. And what we did is we set up a Discord channel with different communication channels for different things. For example, there is a channel for basically discussing project updates, and there's another channel about like competitions, and on the channel about stakeholders management. And that is mainly through communicating through asynchronous updates, and we also have Google Drives for shared documents, and also Notion for Kanban boards on different tasks, and etc. And we also set up a routine in having this kind of infrequent meetings every month to ensure everyone is updated.",
      "In the past few years, I've been innovating mainly in the intersection between software and also biology. And I believe I'm capable in managing software projects and also in designing engineering biology projects and also architecture. But I've hit like a knowledge ceiling. And what I cannot do or understand is how the hardware layer works. And that hardware is critical in terms of scaling up, for example, bio-reactors and that kind of solutions. And with that in place, I want to apply for the Mirai Innovation Institute program in order to learn how engineers think, how they approach problems, and also leave with the engineering intuition. And I can basically understand how hardware works. And I'll be able to upskill in terms of the hardware and also robotics.",
      "I guess I can reframe this question as, how can I add value to this program and how can we mutually benefit? From my past experience, I have over 10 years of research experience in biology, including engineering biology and synthetic biology, and also I have been leading different projects by joining over 200 competitions and also winning over 45 of them. I'm really quick at pattern recognition and also creativity in coming up novel solutions to problems. And with that, I believe I can mainly benefit the program by bringing new perspectives and also having a fresh pair of eyes towards engineering programs and also enabling interdisciplinary research and projects."

      "I approach the electrical harness design with a strong focus on reliability, safety and maintainability. All of those processes require a lot of standards, so I had to work with different standards internationally. Since I worked in Germany in a rocketry company, I was in charge of making all the things related with the connections between sensors and actuators inside of the rocket, taking measurements of different values inside of the rocket, so it was critical to have a big process and structure. I had to be really organized because there were a lot of different parameters that could change, so I had to emphasize in the trustability and the testing because aerospace is delicate, so I had to be really careful. So yeah, it's critical for the mission, the safety and the standards and all the integration behind all of these kind of systems",
      "Yes, 10 years ago when I started working in the electronics sector, I started learning different tools in the CAD side, designing all the layouts and all the things that need to be taken into account in a lot of these projects and systems. And regarding the aerospace sector, I had to take, same as the last one, the reliability and all the integrity, the grounding, the fault tolerance as well, since you have to design and then check, testing, verification, it has to be like that a lot of times, you have to make a lot of redundancy, and the testing again and again. So for me, testing and all of this retaking of details, it's crucial. So yeah, I validated a lot of designs and I had to take, well, to use my knowledge in different tools. It was essential. I validated designs and that's how I did with Avionics and related PCB design",
      "Yes, I remember when I presented my project in Paris. It was in the International Astronautical Congress in 2022. I was the leader of this project. We presented a scientific paper. So at the time, I remember that my team were really nervous, so I had to basically take the role of the leader. They were like so exhausted and nervous, and then they started having different issues, and they wanted to fight each other. So I had to take the point of views, recognizing the individual strengths and the points that could be taken into the discussion. So I think it's important to break those point of views and then taking into the consensus so you can solve the problem and to make feel everyone heard, communication is key. I think that's crucial. It's a milestone, and it's crucial for the leadership in the teamwork. So that's how I deal with this kind of issues, to be heard",
      "Okay, yeah, I can say that I handle conflicts by addressing them thoroughly and objectively, listening to everybody. Like I said in the last question, it's crucial to have communication, to be heard. I think it's vital for this kind of issues. So, the conflict resolution that I usually take as a leader, it's you tell me what do you think about this and you about this. If you have two sides, you have to be like really impartial and then you have to try to solve the situation. And then if you take the tension into opportunity to improve, I think that's the best thing you can do. And it improves the environment and the stronger collaboration inside of the team. So, I think it's also part of the leadership to be able to have this ability to take the point of view and being heard. I think the communication is vital, like I said before, it's crucial for te",
      "Since I have already passed through the process of application to the MIRI program, I realized that Mirai Innovation Research Institute has the same values as I have as a person. It takes innovation, research, and global collaboration, and I think it makes a real world impact. So that's why I really want to be part of this program. I think Mirai allows me to learn from Japan innovation culture, and in the meanwhile, actively participate in the future or interior research. And all of this technology development, I think it's crucial for the future inspiration for different new generations, of course for the developing countries as I am. So I think it represents like a platform for me to jump into the future of new big projects. So I take this like an investment for the future and take more experience for experts around the world. This environment is exactly where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.",
      "I come from a region with limited access to dense aerospace education and new technologies, so I think this scholarship is not only an opportunity for me, it's an investment for the future global collaboration. I can bring knowledge and I could contribute with these advancements, so I think I deserve and I'm the best fit and best candidate for this opportunity because I have leadership, I've been working in different projects and I have consistently working through the several years, past years, working in these new technologies and well, I personally love Japan as well, so I think these two things, building and mixing aerospace technologies and my favorite culture, which is Japan and Asia, I think I'm the best fit. I'm actively studying and trying to be really consistent with what I want and so I think I'm the best candidate for this. This scholarship will enable long term impact, not just individual benefit."

      "Of course, I have integrated both tools of R and MATLAB that I have received in my education at UNAM throughout my research experience to handle different types of complex data. In R specifically, during my internship at the University of Montreal, I developed scripts to process large-scale epigenetic datasets from cut-around experiments. I use R for statistical normalization and generating heatmaps and profile plots to visualize chromatin accessibility during neurodevelopment. I have used it also for many other small projects during my bachelor's degree.",
      "Yes, I have used MATLAB. I have received MATLAB education or guidance during my neuroscience degree at UNAM, and I have used it during my time at the Laboratory of Behavioral and Plasticity. I utilized it to analyze datasets from rat models. I focused on automating the tracking of sexual reward behavior, which allowed for a more objective quantification of the kiss and expression effects. This project that I used it in, they taught me how to move beyond basic computation and use programming as a tool to extract meaningful biological insights from maybe noisy experimental data that we can have sometimes.",
      "I handle multicultural conflicts by prioritising active listening and establishing a common technical language, centred on the project's goals. Nothing ever needs to be personal. I believe that in a diverse team, disagreements are often just different perspectives. And even if they are different, I can see how everything can be applied to the same thing. For example, during my research in Canada, I worked in a bilingual environment with researchers from various academic backgrounds, and we once had a disagreement regarding the statistical normalization of cut-and-run analysis, and instead of arguing, we talked about it, saw the different perspectives, and together we decided what was the best decision to make based on our goal for this project.",
      "My adaptability was most tested during my transition at St. Justin Research Center in Canada. I arrived as a neuroscience student and with a background in behavioral studies from Mexico, but I had to immediately integrate into high-level epigenetic analysis and teamworking with the cut-and-run technique. So not only was I adapted to a new country and a new language, I was in a professional environment and I also had to bridge a significant technical gap that I have in bioinformatics, but I had to develop the skills and I put in the work, put in the hours, and I handled this by leveraging the resilience I gained during my exchange programs and by putting well putting in the extra hours for it to work.",
      "My motivation for this program stems from a desire to transform fundamental neuroscience into tangible technological solutions. Until recently, I have focused mostly on molecular biology, but I really do think it is important to bridge the gap between neuroscience and innovation. And throughout my academic journey, from studying behavior to epigenetics, I have gained a deep understanding of the biological mechanisms of the brain. However, I realize that to truly help patients, to truly help people with neurodevelopmental disorders, we must bridge this gap between the wet lab and innovation. I am specifically drawn to MIRA Innovation because of its interdisciplinary approach. I am very excited about that, and I want to move beyond traditional research and learn how to integrate everything that I have learned and learn also this new perspective. ",
      "I believe I deserve a place in this program because I offer a unique combination of rigorous scientific training and I have a proven global mindset. Through my research in Mexico and in Canada, I have mastered complex techniques and I have proved that I have the technical discipline required for high-level innovation. I have faced a lot of challenges and every time I always come up on top because I put in the work and I put in the hours and my academic journey across these countries has built a level of resilience and adaptability that I think is rare. And on the more grand scales, I want to not only bring my own perspective to this program, but I also want to bring back what I learned to Mexico to bridge this gap between neuroscience and technology also in my home country and hopefully give a different perspective in Japan. Thank you."

      "I worked in prototype development in various projects, both during my time as a research assistant at university, during my studies, as well during my time at my startup, where I developed robotic grippers and actuation systems. I normally have quite a hands-on approach, starting with digital and physical prototyping relatively early in the progress and nonetheless doing a detailed analysis of the requirements which a product needs to fulfil and looking at a wide variety of potential solutions, including some out-of-the-box thinking approaches to really reach novel innovative solutions. Thank you",
      "So I'm currently working on a project still with my professor at the University of Birmingham as a continuation of my master project where we apply deep learning to on MEG signals from our Imagined Speech experiment, with the aim of translating those brain signals signals into brain representations of speech in generative audio models and as such generate or translate brain representations into machine-readable representations of speech. So we designed an entire experiment, created our own data set and now we're trying to solve this decoding and modeling problem with a wide range of different deep learning algorithms and architectures",
      "One of my main responsibilities at the start-up is the design research and organisation of projects for grant applications to acquire new research funds. There I regularly design research projects, organize and  bigger and international research consortiums. I have one example where we coordinated three Swiss partners with a French partner currently working with partners in Germany, including both Eurostars, Eureka and  Horizon Europe projects. In this consortium it's really important to be aware of the interests of all members and really play on the strengths of each of them to get the best results",
      "I think culturally, Swiss people are very focused on finding a common ground and I think that's also my approach when it comes to conflicts. It's important to really get an hollistic overview of the situation, to see and recognise the viewpoints of all involved parties and in their circumstances. With this, it's mostly really easy to find a conclusion where the team can continue to be effective and work together towards a common goal. It's just a matter of clear communication and alignment on these common goals. ",
      "As you can certainly see from my CV, I really also did see myself reflected in the advert for the MIRAI Innovation Programme, I bringing a fascination for virtual reality, robotics, a background in computational neuroscience, the processing of neuroimaging data. And also now actively pursuing a research career together with a deep cultural interest in Japan has led me to decide to apply to this programme and I'd be honoured to collaborate with the researchers at Mirai for a better future of Japan and the world. ",
      "I think I excelled both academically as well as with my entrepreneurial background, having both graduated with a distinction in computational neuroscience from the University of Birmingham last year, as well as having co-founded a robotics startup which now has successfully launched its first product on the market, has won various awards along the way, as someone who has already published scientific papers as part of his work as a research assistant at Zurich University of Applied Science. I also fit the research focus of the lab, with AI, neuroscience, robotics and VR experiance. And also I think I really share the same motivation of the MIRAI Innovation Lab founder, wanting to work towards a better future for people around the globe by the main driving force of innovation and research."

      "Yes, I can. So my team and I at the BEAR Lab for UC Davis worked at developing C++, primarily, for the control flow of a smart prosthetic that was picking up the motor intentions of a patient that was looking to move a robotic hand. There wasn't as much Linux involved. In fact, actually, the operating system of choice was Windows. But at other times, I have used Linux for my own development of embedded systems, which were for projects that were outside the scope of what I was researching at UC Davis.",
      "The key ways I have used Python in my work with robotics or smart prosthetics at UC Davis was through two major ways. One is the development of AI models, particularly with PyTorch, for training off of processed biosignals and determining either motor intentions of the individual, as in the case for a smart prosthetic hand, or for the emotional state of an individual with some research I helped my team conduct off of fMRI data. Aside from that, I have also helped the team at Bear Lab with the smart prosthetic hand, and I've also done my own work with Python for automation.",
      "One of the most challenging projects I believe I've worked on in this field was actually not at my time at UC Davis, but was instead at a robotics company in Shanghai, China, DF Robot. At that time, I was working very hard to help one of my teams develop the automated control set GUI for a 6-axis robotic arm. My contributions came primarily through learning as much of inverse kinematics as I could for the sake of the project, and then helping my team to develop the automation commands for the rest of the project. The communication that I helped with was through using their native tongue, Mandarin, and through organizing some of the key aspects of the project. Thank you.",
      "When a team has members who have differing opinions and start to struggle with which they're going to adopt, I usually try to lengthen the conversation. Usually there is a difference in perspective on the matter and that needs to be understood as best as possible. And it's usually, I find that if you help people to really relay their perspective in the best way possible, really make it known to all members of the team, conclusions tend to just sort of naturally form. People then are armed with the understanding to know which way to move forward. Most times it's just that simple",
      "Ah, okay. I want to join the Mirai Innovation Research Immersion Program for two reasons. The first reason is that at this point in my life, I am as certain as one can be that my life's direction is taking me to Japan, since the number of work opportunities that deal with research at the intersection of medicine and technology are growing in Japan, and I am determined to live in Japan and find what cultural immersion can be like there. The second reason is that I hope for the MIRI program to give me chances to work with the experienced mentors and fellow students and graduates and people working directly in the industry settings who themselves are contributing to the body of research in smart prosthetics. If the immersion of this program can tackle both the immersion in technology research for fields like smart prosthetics and also the immersion in Japanese culture, then this absolutely is the perfect program for me.",
      "I believe that the scholarship should be given to anyone with great academic achievements, and I can say for myself that I am proud of the academic achievements I have at UC Davis and the ones I have made prior to my time at UC Davis. And what they mean to me is that they are actually the start--much like a driver's license is the start of you officially driving--I feel like these achievements are the start of me actually going on a long journey to learn and study every facet of smart prosthetics that I can so that I will be able to make great contributions to the body of research in smart prosthetics"

      "So most of my experience with Java comes from my coursework in faculty of ICT at Mahidol University. I used it to learn and apply object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. I also applied Java in web programming projects where I worked on the backend to implement basic application logic and support the web functionality alongside the Java. I also used JavaScript on the front end to create simple interactive features which help me understand how different parts of the web application connect. Through this project, I developed a solid foundation in Java and backend development, so I'm eager to continue learning and apply this skill in real-world internship environment.",
      "I used React in a university project to develop a web application with reusable components and dynamic user interfaces, which helped me understand how React managed the component-based design. One challenge I faced was setting up and maintaining the consistent development environment. There were cases where differences in React or library versions caused warnings or unexpected behavior, especially when switching between machine or tools. To address this, I learned to check documentation carefully, manage dependency, and use version control to keep projects stable. Through this experience, I improved my ability to troubleshoot front-end issues and gained a better understanding of how React projects are structured and maintained.",
      "During a university group project related to SAATM air traffic communication, our team faced a conflict because some tasks were highly dependent on each other. This led to overlapping work and confusion about responsibility which caused strife within the team. To address this, we used daily scrum-style meeting where each member clearly communicated what they have completed, what they were working on, and any problems they faced. I actively participated in this discussion by clarifying task boundaries and making sure dependencies were clearly understood. So, as a result, the team became more aligned, redundancies were reduced, and we were able to adapt more quickly to an issue. This experience showed me how effective communication and regular check-in can help resolve conflicts and keep the team working smoothly.",
      "When working in a team, I start by listing all the tasks and prioritizing them based on the importance and urgency. We categorize tasks as urgent and important, important but not urgent, or low priority. After that, we assign tasks in a way that minimizes dependency so team members can work in parallel without waiting for others. If someone finishes early, they help support all the tasks that are still in progress. This approach helps the team stay organized, reduce delay, and use our time efficiently while maintaining flexibility.",
      "My motivation for applying to Mirai Innovation Research Institute stemmed from my previous experience at JAIST where I learned that research is a powerful way to try innovation and advance technology in a meaningful way. That experience made me want to further develop my research skills in a professional research environment. I believe this program at Mirai would allow me to deepen my technical knowledge while contributing to innovation research projects that have real-world impact. I am particularly motivated by the opportunity to learn from researchers and apply my skills in a collaborative setting. In addition, I admire Japanese research culture, especially in its emphasis on discipline, precision, and continuous improvement, which strongly aligns with how I want to grow as a researcher and engineer.",
      "I believe I deserve this scholarship because I have demonstrated both strong motivation and ability to grow in a research environment. Through my applied internship at JAIST, I gained hands-on experience and proved that I can adapt to academic research, learn independently, and contribute meaningfully to technical projects. I am highly motivated to continue developing my skills and apply them to create innovative technologies that I can contribute to the research community. This scholarship would allow me to fully focus on research and maximize my potential to contribute to the future of technological advancements. Additionally, I stated that I admire Japanese culture which aligns with my personal work ethics."

      "Great. Can you describe a project where you utilize machine learning algorithms to solve a specific problem? Well, one project I'm actually currently working on is healthcare computer vision for tauopathies classification, Alzheimer's-related neurodegenerative disease, from immunofluorescence microscopy. That's actually my recent work. The actual problem was manual slide reviews are slow and can be subjective, so I build models to classify disease patterns and explain their decisions. Regarding the machine learning approach, I train strong CNN baselines with a leakage-free pipeline and added granular explainability, for example, eigengradcam, grad-cam and occlusion checks, to verify the model focuses on relevant regions, not artifacts. Regarding the current extension, I'm now benchmarking VLMs, or visual language models, with zero-fish-shot and supervised fine-tuning, some post-training techniques such as SFT, including medical BLMs like MedGemma from Google and models like Gwen, you know, the Chinese ones, to compare accuracy",
      "Okay, how have you applied your skills in cloud computing to enhance the performance of a data analysis project? So, I don't want to overuse my Microsoft internship experience, but I'm going to use it anyways. Well, in my Microsoft internship, I used cloud tools to make a data analysis workflow faster, more scalable, and easier to iterate on. I worked with large, production datasets by querying and navigating in Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) instead of pulling everything locally, which reduced latency and made experiments reproducible. I also run heavier modeling and feature engineering on cloud compute, so I could iterate quickly, then share results through lightweight deliverables like dashboards and a Streamlit What-If simulator for stakeholders. Overall, cloud helped me move from one-off analysis to a scalable pipeline with reliable, repeatable outputs. And that's it. Thank you",
      "Okay, can you provide an example of how you effectively communicated a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience? Okay, so I'm going to use again my experience in Microsoft cause it's worth it for this case. So, during my Microsoft internship, I had to explain a predictive modeling result to stakeholders, who were not machine learning specialists, obviously, basically the PMs. Instead of starting with algorithms, I framed it as a risk and decision story. Which services are most likely to trigger action items, and what can we change to reduce that risk? I used simple visuals, sub-drivers, and before-after scenarios, and built a small what-if simulator, so they could adjust a few inputs and immediately see how the predicted risk changed. I also clarified limits in plain language, like, this is not a guarantee, it is probability based on historical patterns. And summarized the ticket weight as a short set of actions, rather than technical metrics. And that's it. Thank you",
      "I get it. So, regarding this question, I think I handled team conflicts by keeping the focus on the shared goal and the facts, not personalities, basically. First of all, what we are trying to achieve by when and what success looks like. Maybe as a second point, listen to each side separately and together to understand the real root cause, misaligned assumptions on peer ownership, different risk tolerance, or communication gaps. Number three, kind of like make the disagreement concrete. Write down options, trade-offs, and what data will resolve it. Number four, maybe propose a small testable plan, a quick prototype, a comparison, or a short spike, so the decision is evidence-based. Finally, agree on the next steps in writing and set a check-in to ensure momentum. Basically, overall, this is how I think this approach keeps collaborating strong, turns conflict into a structured decision, and prevents the same issue from repeating over and over again. That's it. Thanks again!",
      "Great, so I'm applying because Miri is kind of like a rare chance to spend three months fully focused on hands-on research in Japan, in exactly the areas I'm building my career around, in this case AI, computer vision, and robotics, with a strong mentorship and the goal of producing publishable outcomes. My background spans robotic systems, industry ML, including my Microsoft internship, of course, and research with multiple publications across healthcare and agriculture computer vision. What I want next is an environment where I can move fast from idea to prototype to results, using state-of-the-art tools like vision language models, VLMs, and multi-modal pipelines, maybe agents, and collaborate closely with researchers in a lab setting. Finally, I'm also motivated by the international aspects. I value Japanese research culture and I want to deepen my network and experience in Japan while contributing real output to Mirai's projects. And actually, I want to come back to Japan, you know. Thank you",
      "Okay, it seems that I have to do all over again, okay. I believe, first of all, that I deserve this scholarship because I have a proven track record of turning opportunities into real, measurable outcomes, and I will use MIRI to produce high-quality research that represents MIRI well. Second of all, I combine academic excellence and innovation with execution. I have multiple peer-reviewed publications across computer vision and machine learning, including work presented at CVPR workshops, and I'm currently extending my research toward a journal submission. I also bring a strong industry experience, including my Microsoft internship and an applied scientist internship in Japan, where I build real systems on real data and communicate our results to stakeholders. And finally, most importantly, I'm ready to contribute immediately at MIRI. I can move from ideas to prototype quickly, work independently with mentorship, and deliver outcomes such as a working demo, a technical report, and a publishable paper. I believe that's it. I'm pretty excited to be here. Thank you. And finally, I had to do it all over again, so I don't know why. The platform? Thank you still!"

      "C++ is a really powerful language because it allows me to control the memory at low level. I've worked with embedded systems like Arduino, but most of the time I tend to work into more complex things, for example game engines from scratch using only OpenGL, and I've touched a little bit of Vulkan. I generally make simulations and to design logic and make this performant code. For example, I've made a ray tracing engine to understand the core principles about ray tracing and all the math. I've also programmed a little bit of simulations and more with Java about physics simulation and I have a deep understanding about the language",
      "Docker is a powerful tool because it allows you to decouple things into modules and build into production more easily. For example, instead of having a database and the backend, the API, and the frontend or the code that shows the frontend, instead of having everything mixed together, it's more easily if you configure everything into a separate Docker and then you mix it to production. For example, the benefits is, for example, I've worked into my local computer and I can, for example, use Windows and then upload my web page to other external services and I'm sure that I'm not going to have problems with dependencies, for example, for my web page or in the past, or I've used it to prevent those conflicts between your local machine and the external machine you're trying deploy to.",
      "For example, this summer I've managed a team of three persons, I was the leader, and we were trying to design the core principles and how the system should be managed and interact for my game Industrialized, that it's under my personal brand Electrodiux. So we had to figure out how to manage scalability as well as performance, and for example to mix different backgrounds, OpenGL, Vulkan, to be able to make optimizations and also have the abstraction power. So we've designed general code maps of how things should be structured, and I've designed a roadmap and managed the tasks with the team with Trello. And that showed me that good code starts always with a good design first, and then you implement the solution instead of trying to implement the solution without a plan before",
      "I've been a programming and robotics tutor from children to university students. When I try to explain and give my classes I always try to demystify the things out of the black box and explain first the core principles and understand why things work the way they work and not just to try to explain just the steps you must follow to reach x or do y. I always try to that everyone really understands this the concept by explaining the core principles and using real world analogies like for example the clock CPU with a heartbeat or or everything like that. I try to always explain the things as easy as possible because I think that if you are not able to explain something simply it's because you don't understand it well enough.",
      "I have several reasons of why I want to join this program. The first of all is your focus about robotics and human-augmented reality. So I think that fits my profile because I'm used to work with with simulation engines. Also I have hardware knowledge and it's related to the things I love and I'm passionate about. And I think this program is a bridge between the real world of robotics and the breakthrough technology of AI. I also have interest about Japanese culture. I'm a self-taught Japanese learner. I started learning two years ago. And I think this program is just the first steps of my long-term career goal to contribute to Japan's research ecosystem and probably in the future get there, work there for a company or research. So it's a really important first step for me",
      "I think that I should be awarded with this scholarship because I'm a really rare hybrid profile that I have the knowledge from transistors and logic gates to more everything in between operating systems all through all to AI and modern systems. I've built an 8-bit computer from scratch, I also have made a lot of game engines and I have a deep understanding about how robotics work and how modern technology like AI work and I also have a passing research when for example I won the prize Fernando Cabrera about research and where I've talked about the technology of the telescopes in the Canary Islands and I also have knowledge about the Japanese language and I'm easily able to adapt to the culture and the language required for this scholarship."

      "I'm pursuing my MBA program as a part-time program on Saturdays and Sundays. So during my normal week from Mondays to Fridays, I'm a full-time employee for Airbus here in Hamburg. I am supporting our team, our transnational team, as a Business Support Manager. So there I need data-driven decision-making every day. For example, with regards to performance management, we're using AI to analyze quality data and then to find the information we are needing, to use the information to improve quality, for example. So I am applying it every day and also, of course, in university projects, in the AI projects and the AI literacy project that I'm currently working on. ",
      "I'm using design thinking, for example, in two different ways. One is a current AI literacy project at Airbus that I'm working on. I'm leading this project and I'm in charge of all the four work streams. And there, for example, we do design thinking workshops together with our employees in order to find out what are their concrete needs and to understand better how we can translate those needs in our AI digital solutions that we are currently developing. Second thing is, for the design thinking, I was a scholarship holder for the so-called TNCC program in 2025, where I was able to visit the Silicon Valley together with other scholarship holders. And there, we also had design thinking strategy workshops, talking about global challenges, for example, sustainability that I'm very excited about. My motto in life is one step further for a better future. That was a great opportunity to develop my innovation as well as intercultural skills. ",
      "Communication, and in particular transcultural communication, is one of my core skills. I'm using communication every day in my professional life as a business support manager. I'm supporting our vice president of more than 400 employees acress four sites worldwide. With regards to all management communications, I'm for example leading our team meeting and I obviously need to take care of all four different sites that we're working on, so we have employees in Hamburg, Toulouse, Tianjin and Mobile, and all four sites have their different requirements, have their own local cultural needs, so that's where I'm demonstrating effective communication every day. Also, the AI literacy project is transnational and requires project communication. ",
      "I think especially when it comes to innovation, conflicts can be also a good thing. Conflicts can be a source of creativity. So in general, I don't avoid conflicts. I try to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable, where everyone feels comfortable to speak out all the thoughts they have, where everyone feels comfortable to share feedback. So you can then discuss it together and resolve any conflicts and use it maybe as a good opportunity for some new ideas. Maybe there is something to improve, for example, and when no one speaks up, then you cannot resolve conflicts and improve. So for me, my problem-solving approach is always to create an environment where people are comfortable, where people are speaking about what they are thinking, and then you can sit all together, discuss pros and cons, and then find a good compromise together. ",
      "So for me, there are two main motivations to applying to this great program of Mira Innovation Research Institute. First of all, I'm excited to learn more about AI, robotics, VR, about future-ready technologies, and I would really like to deep dive a little bit more and use this three-month program to, yeah, really just focus on one thing. I will stop and pause my job for this three-month period, so I have really time to learn more about the technologies. And second motivation for me is, the environment. I'm really looking forward to learn more about Japanese culture and business environemtn. I haven't been to Japan, so that would be a great opportunity with the scholarship. And I'm also excited to learn from my fellow students, from all the people that I will meet there. And I think it's a great opportunity, to strengthen the cross-country collaboration to learn from each other. And yeah, that's my two biggest motivations",
      "I deserve to be awarded this scholarship because I'm an innovation enthusiast. I have a very strong, excellent academic background, with already two scholarships of the German government. I am bringing the perfect combination of industrial engineering, as well as leadership and innovation, so I can benefit from this project, but also contribute to the research which is carried out at Mirai Innovation University. So I'm looking forward to learn from my fellow students, but also contribute to their learning journey. And I'm also excited to learn more about Japanese culture, Japanese business environment, and to also bring some German, some maybe German background, some maybe German tradition to Japan. So I'm looking forward to this, and investing in me is taking a step together into the future, taking together a step further for a better society. Thank you"

    "answers": [
      "My experience with 3D modeling software can be seen when I used Fusion 360 to model my design of a voice-controlled robotic arm that feeds users with impairments, people that can't use their hands, or people that have medical conditions that they are not able to use their hands to eat. So I designed the software, I designed the robotic arm to be able to fit the user's descriptions to be able to eat. i ensured the motors and actuators fit the design to make it capable of delivering food and also safe for the users to use",
      "So, for troubleshooting issues involving DHCP and DNS, for example, we start with DHCP, where users, in my experience, usually describe issues where they don't get network, usually resulting to an IPIPA IP, which is an IP that's gotten when the device does not connect to the DHCP server. I troubleshoot it by looking at their MAC addresses, looking at their locations, looking at where the routers are and their default gateways. As for DNS, we use applications of platforms called CloudStrike or Firewalls, which is able to translate those IPs into public IPs for them to be seen and for them to reach a URL. I compare them and ensure that they are allowed and protected on the network, if the URL being reached is malicious it will be flagged and blocked on the firewalls",
      "So we had an experience where auditors, we call them, they are people that move between branches in our bank. They go to different branches and they are able to plug in and play, which means that they can get an IP with the bank's network at any branch you go with no restrictions. So that was because the DHCP servers there allow them to be able to automatically get IPs, which we did not want because it's an infringement and it's a vulnerability. So we looked at ways we could solve that issue and the way we solved it was by creating the users manually using static IPv4 mapping, map addressing. So we statically binded each user, which was a tedious task, but we were able to do it to avoid users moving from branch to branch and getting access. And when they needed access, they had to send an email which required an approval from their group heads for us to be able to map them statically in those branches.",
      "When I have multiple projects with tight deadlines, I create a table, if you can call it a scale of preference, where each project is set based on some criteria, which are time, most importantly, and then difficulty, cost, resources that will be used, and then time in terms of how long it will take to complete it. So when all those projects are drawn on that table, the one that meets all those parameters the most is the one that will be on the highest, on the top list. And so how I manage my time is by avoiding the distractions, focusing on that specific project, and then putting all my time and effort into it. Try not to get too burnt out, because being burnt out can reduce the time you have on that project. But taking it easily and being focused on it, and also not neglecting the projects that come after by doing a little work on the w ",

      "Hello, I'll start by understanding the objective and the why of the data. What variable do you want to predict or explain? And what does a correct data mean? Then I make a quick version to detect typical problems, missing, duplicated, out-of-range values, inconsistencies of format, and possible biases due to the origin of the data. Then I clean in layers, first simple and traceable rules, and then finer validations according to the case. I always separate data cleaning and modeling so as not to contaminate the experiment. I mainly use Python tools with Pandas and NumPy for quick visualization, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and if the project asks for it, I document the process and leave reusable functions, with version control so that the cleaning is replicable. Thank you",
      "Hello again. I have used Docker to ensure that my projects run the same on any machine. In practice, what has helped me the most is to eliminate the in my computer if it works, I set dependencies, versions and environment variables and I can launch services with the same configuration in development and deployment. In projects with App and Backend, Docker allowed me to package the service, test it in a controlled way and share it with other people without them depending on my local environment. It also facilitates collaboration, anyone can clone the repository and run the system with minimal steps. In short, Docker gives reproducibility, speed to iterate and less friction when moving from development to production. Thank you. Thank you",
      "Hello again. In a Datatone, I worked with a team where the main challenge was to coordinate imperfect data, little time and quick technical decisions. My role was to help structure the workflow so that the team advanced without losing control. We divided the problem into blocks, cleaning and preparation, modeling, evaluation and presentation. I focused on leaving the technical part well connected, that what was cleaned fed the model correctly, and that the metrics were clear to compare alternatives. The key was to maintain a short communication rhythm, quick agreements, well-delimited tasks and frequent revisions. That allowed us to train a complete and defensible solution over time. I was also part of the team within the university, which allowed me to have the experience of collaborating with different people",
      "The first thing is to align expectations. What does it mean? Success. What deliverables are needed and on what date? Then I translate the technical part to decisions. What is going to be done, why and what impact does it have? I avoid saturating with details, but I do leave evidence and traceability for those who need it. It works a lot for me to work with short and constant updates. What did I do? What's next? What blockages are there? I also use simple definitions to avoid misunderstandings and I confirm agreements in writing when the project requires it. My goal is that everyone understands the progress, even if they come from different areas, and that communication reduces friction instead of creating it, as well as using assertiveness and clear communication as the main axis of collaboration. Thank you",
      "My motivation is to grow in an environment where the standard is high and the work becomes real results. I am interested because I combine mentoring, research and execution in an international context, and that speeds up learning in a way that can hardly be replicated from home. I want to take advantage of the excellence to raise my technical and professional level and come out with a solid project that I can defend with evidence. And for me, the return is also important. I want to return with applied knowledge, with high-level work practices and with a result that contributes to my academic environment and my region. Thank you very much",
      "Hello again. I deserve this scholarship because I am going to take advantage of it with seriousness and with results. I come from a place where this type of opportunity does not seem easy and that is why when they open, I respond with discipline and constancy. I already had to demonstrate my work in an international environment and I learned to maintain the level, work hard, be clear and support what I say with results. If they choose me, I do not come to test my luck. I come to represent well, to work to the maximum and to return with a solid deliverable that has real value. And also, there will be a way for more students from where I come from"
